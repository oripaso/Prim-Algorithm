# Prim-Algorithm

A function that receives a graph and a weight function (list of edge nodes and weights for each edge)
and returns a minimum spanning tree of that graph by running the PRIM algorithm.
In the second part of the project, I wrote a function that accepts a minimum spanning tree, a newly added edge and its weight. 
The function updates the spanning tree with the addition of the new edge.

I ran the program with a graph with 20 nodes and 50 edges and weights.
The program will find a minimal spanning tree and print it.
I created a new edge and printed it - an edge which does not change the spanning tree.
I found the updated spanning tree and printed it to the screen.
I created an edge that will indeed change the spanning tree and printed it.
I screen printed the updated spanning tree.
